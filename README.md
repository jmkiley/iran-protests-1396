# iran-protests-1396


Tracking reports of protests in Iran. GeoJSON is available with known dates of protest by city. Data primarily comes from the [protests' Wikipedia article](https://fa.wikipedia.org/wiki/تظاهرات_۱۳۹۶_ایران). This data was then edited with the Mapbox Datasets Editor. I'm sure that I have made errors, so please let me know if anything is missing. 

Goals:

- Track protests.

In progress:

- Add reports of injuries and deaths.
